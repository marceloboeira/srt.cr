1
00:02:50,904 --> 00:02:52,929
Help me!

2
00:02:53,006 --> 00:02:55,406
Somebody, help me out.

3
00:02:56,576 --> 00:02:59,272
Somebody, help me over here!

4
00:03:08,288 --> 00:03:10,984
Somebody, help me out!

5
00:03:12,392 --> 00:03:14,087
Oh, my God!

6
00:03:28,274 --> 00:03:31,175
Walt! Walt!

7
00:03:31,244 --> 00:03:34,475
- Stay away from the gas! Stay there!

8
00:03:44,123 --> 00:03:46,591
Help! Help!

9
00:03:46,659 --> 00:03:48,854
Somebody, help me!

10
00:03:56,803 --> 00:03:59,704
Oh, my leg!

11
00:04:03,676 --> 00:04:06,144
Hey, get over here.
Give me a hand.

12
00:04:06,212 --> 00:04:09,704
You, come on!
Come over here! Give me a hand!

13
00:04:09,782 --> 00:04:11,716
On the count of three.

14
00:04:11,784 --> 00:04:15,550
One, two, three!

15
00:04:31,471 --> 00:04:35,373
Help! Please, help me!

16
00:04:35,441 --> 00:04:37,773
Help me! Please, help me!

17
00:04:39,712 --> 00:04:42,579
Get him out of here.
Get him away from the engine.

18
00:04:42,649 --> 00:04:44,810
Get him out of here.

19
00:04:48,955 --> 00:04:50,980
Help me!

20
00:04:51,057 --> 00:04:53,651
Please, help me.
I'm having contractions!

21
00:04:53,726 --> 00:04:56,752
- How many months pregnant are you?
- Only eight months.

22
00:04:56,829 --> 00:05:00,265
- How far apart are they coming?
- I don't know, a few just happened!

23
00:05:02,135 --> 00:05:05,002
Hey! Get away from there!

24
00:05:17,483 --> 00:05:20,418
Listen to me! Look at me!
You're gonna be okay.

25
00:05:20,486 --> 00:05:24,388
Do you understand me?
But you have to sit absolutely still.

26
00:05:28,161 --> 00:05:30,595
Hey! You! Come here!

27
00:05:30,663 --> 00:05:34,155
I need you to get this woman away
from these fumes. Take her there.

28
00:05:34,233 --> 00:05:38,192
Stay with her. If her contractions occur
closer than three minutes, call me!

29
00:05:38,271 --> 00:05:40,705
- You gotta be kidding me.
- I'll be right back.

30
00:05:40,773 --> 00:05:42,866
Thank you.

31
00:05:42,942 --> 00:05:45,467
Hey! What's your name?

32
00:05:46,446 --> 00:05:48,175
Jack!

33
00:05:49,716 --> 00:05:53,550
Stop! Her head's not tilted back enough.
You're blowing into her stomach.

34
00:05:53,619 --> 00:05:58,181
You sure? That's exactly what I was
doing. I'm a lifeguard. I'm licensed.

35
00:05:58,257 --> 00:06:01,283
You need to think about
giving that license back.

36
00:06:01,361 --> 00:06:05,730
Maybe we should do one of those hole
things. Stick the pen in the throat?

37
00:06:05,798 --> 00:06:08,995
Yeah, good idea. You go get me a pen.

38
00:06:11,738 --> 00:06:14,707
Does anyone have any pens?
Do you have a pen?

39
00:06:14,774 --> 00:06:16,901
- Does anybody have a pen?
- Come on!

40
00:06:18,311 --> 00:06:20,040
Come on!

41
00:06:20,480 --> 00:06:23,574
Come on! Come on!

42
00:06:29,222 --> 00:06:31,156
Big deep breaths.
Big breaths.

43
00:06:47,573 --> 00:06:49,973
Move! Move! Move!

44
00:06:50,042 --> 00:06:51,976
Get her up! Get her out of there!

45
00:07:16,536 --> 00:07:19,630
- You okay?
- Yeah. Yeah.

46
00:07:19,705 --> 00:07:21,764
You?

47
00:07:21,841 --> 00:07:25,402
- Stay with her.
- Dude, I'm not going anywhere.

48
00:08:15,328 --> 00:08:18,024
I didn't know
which one would work best.

49
00:08:25,271 --> 00:08:28,707
They're all good. Thanks.

50
00:10:07,607 --> 00:10:08,904
Excuse me.

51
00:10:11,777 --> 00:10:14,371
Did you ever use a needle?

52
00:10:15,314 --> 00:10:19,410
- What?
- Did you ever patch a pair of jeans?

53
00:10:22,955 --> 00:10:24,820
l, uh...

54
00:10:25,858 --> 00:10:29,760
- I made the drapes in my apartment.
- That's fantastic. Listen...

55
00:10:29,829 --> 00:10:33,230
Do you have a second?
I could use a little help here.

56
00:10:38,037 --> 00:10:40,232
Help with what?

57
00:10:40,306 --> 00:10:43,764
With this. I'd do it myself,
I'm a doctor, but I just can't reach it.

58
00:10:43,843 --> 00:10:46,107
- You want me to sew that?
- Like the drapes.

59
00:10:46,178 --> 00:10:50,171
- I used a sewing machine.
- No, you can do this, I'm telling you.

60
00:10:50,249 --> 00:10:52,114
If you wouldn't mind.

61
00:10:59,392 --> 00:11:02,793
- Of course I will.
- Thank you.

62
00:11:07,099 --> 00:11:09,465
It's for your hand.

63
00:11:12,071 --> 00:11:16,235
Save me some... for the wound.

64
00:11:21,313 --> 00:11:23,110
Any color preference?

65
00:11:25,117 --> 00:11:28,518
No. Standard black.

66
00:12:36,455 --> 00:12:38,548
Come on.

67
00:12:44,296 --> 00:12:46,321
Hey, you!

68
00:12:46,398 --> 00:12:49,424
- What's your name?
- Me? Charlie.

69
00:12:49,502 --> 00:12:53,461
Charlie, we need help with the fire.
No one will see it if it isn't big.

70
00:12:53,539 --> 00:12:56,269
- Okay, I'm on it. What's your name?
- Sayid.

71
00:12:56,342 --> 00:12:59,140
Sayid. I'm on it, Sayid.

72
00:13:10,356 --> 00:13:11,948
I might throw up on you.

73
00:13:13,392 --> 00:13:15,451
You're doing fine.

74
00:13:18,998 --> 00:13:20,989
You don't seem afraid at all.

75
00:13:22,401 --> 00:13:24,028
I don't understand that.

76
00:13:24,970 --> 00:13:28,667
Well, fear's sort of an odd thing.

77
00:13:32,444 --> 00:13:36,574
When I was in residency,
my first solo procedure

78
00:13:36,649 --> 00:13:42,019
was a spinal surgery
on a 16-year-old kid. A girl.

79
00:13:42,721 --> 00:13:48,353
And at the end, after 13 hours,
I was closing her up and I...

80
00:13:49,195 --> 00:13:51,959
I accidentally ripped her dural sack.

81
00:13:52,031 --> 00:13:55,432
It's at the base of the spine
where all the nerves come together.

82
00:13:55,501 --> 00:13:58,766
Membrane as thin as tissue, and...

83
00:13:58,838 --> 00:14:01,568
So it ripped open.

84
00:14:03,008 --> 00:14:07,240
Nerves just spilled
out of her like angel hair pasta,

85
00:14:07,313 --> 00:14:10,339
spinal fluid flowing
out of her and I...

86
00:14:16,188 --> 00:14:18,713
The terror was just so...

87
00:14:19,191 --> 00:14:23,423
...crazy, so real...

88
00:14:24,797 --> 00:14:27,766
...and I knew I had to deal with it.

89
00:14:28,968 --> 00:14:32,062
So I just made a choice.

90
00:14:32,137 --> 00:14:36,164
I'd let the fear in.
Let it take over. Let it do its thing.

91
00:14:36,242 --> 00:14:40,042
But only for five seconds,
that's all I was gonna give it.

92
00:14:40,112 --> 00:14:42,342
So I started to count.

93
00:14:42,414 --> 00:14:45,406
One, two,

94
00:14:45,484 --> 00:14:50,353
three, four, five.

95
00:14:52,825 --> 00:14:54,417
And it was gone.

96
00:14:56,729 --> 00:14:59,857
I went back to work,
sewed her up and she was fine.

97
00:15:01,867 --> 00:15:06,099
If that had been me, I think
I would've run for the door.

98
00:15:07,873 --> 00:15:10,671
No, I don't think that's true.

99
00:15:12,144 --> 00:15:14,840
You're not running now.

100
00:15:31,163 --> 00:15:34,064
You think they
would have come by now.

101
00:15:34,133 --> 00:15:35,395
Hmm?

102
00:15:35,467 --> 00:15:38,630
- Who?
- Anyone.

103
00:15:58,724 --> 00:16:01,522
As if I'm gonna start eating chocolate.

104
00:16:04,163 --> 00:16:08,623
- Shannon, we may be here for a while.
- The plane had a black box, idiot.

105
00:16:08,701 --> 00:16:12,603
They know exactly where we are,
they're coming.

106
00:16:14,373 --> 00:16:17,433
I'll eat on the rescue boat.

107
00:16:17,509 --> 00:16:21,275
I'll eat on the rescue boat.

108
00:16:31,690 --> 00:16:35,922
- Hungry?
- Yeah. Thanks.

109
00:16:37,496 --> 00:16:41,830
Any more...
you know, baby stuff?

110
00:16:41,900 --> 00:16:45,859
No... I'm okay.

111
00:16:48,374 --> 00:16:53,607
- Well, hang in there.
- Yeah, you too.

112
00:17:05,290 --> 00:17:07,952
You sure you're warm enough?

113
00:17:48,067 --> 00:17:50,535
Do you think he's gonna live?

114
00:17:54,640 --> 00:17:57,040
Do you know him?

115
00:17:57,743 --> 00:18:00,735
He was sitting next to me.

116
00:18:08,120 --> 00:18:13,080
We must've been at about
40,000 feet when it happened.

117
00:18:13,158 --> 00:18:16,321
We hit an air pocket and dropped...

118
00:18:16,395 --> 00:18:19,694
...maybe 200 feet.

119
00:18:20,466 --> 00:18:22,991
The turbulence was...

120
00:18:27,573 --> 00:18:29,803
I blacked out.

121
00:18:31,710 --> 00:18:34,042
I didn't.

122
00:18:34,113 --> 00:18:36,581
I saw the whole thing.

123
00:18:40,619 --> 00:18:43,986
I knew that the tail was gone, but I...

124
00:18:44,056 --> 00:18:47,287
...couldn't bring myself to look back.

125
00:18:48,293 --> 00:18:52,252
And then the front end
of the plane broke off.

126
00:18:55,400 --> 00:18:58,062
Well, it's not here on the beach.

127
00:18:58,137 --> 00:18:59,502
Neither is the tail.

128
00:19:02,107 --> 00:19:04,302
We need to figure out
which way we came in.

129
00:19:04,376 --> 00:19:07,345
- Why?
- There's a chance we find the cockpit.

130
00:19:07,412 --> 00:19:10,404
If it's intact, we might be able
to find the transceiver.

131
00:19:10,482 --> 00:19:13,542
We could send out a signal,
help the rescue party find us.

132
00:19:13,619 --> 00:19:16,110
How do you know all that?

133
00:19:17,189 --> 00:19:19,714
I took a couple of flying lessons.

134
00:19:21,593 --> 00:19:23,561
Wasn't for me.

135
00:19:26,565 --> 00:19:29,466
I saw some smoke...

136
00:19:29,535 --> 00:19:31,867
...just through the valley.

137
00:19:35,474 --> 00:19:39,069
If you're thinking about going
for the cockpit, I'm going with you.

138
00:19:47,653 --> 00:19:49,814
I don't know your name.

139
00:19:53,358 --> 00:19:55,349
I'm Kate.

140
00:19:55,661 --> 00:19:57,652
Jack.

141
00:20:13,779 --> 00:20:15,007
What was that?

142
00:20:19,685 --> 00:20:23,121
- That was weird, right?
- Is that Vincent?

143
00:20:23,188 --> 00:20:25,247
It's not Vincent.

144
00:20:29,294 --> 00:20:31,421
Did anybody see that?

145
00:20:33,332 --> 00:20:34,594
Yeah.

146
00:20:34,666 --> 00:20:37,829
- Boone!

147
00:21:10,736 --> 00:21:12,465
Terrific.

148
00:21:29,121 --> 00:21:31,146
So, how's the drink?

149
00:21:32,991 --> 00:21:36,427
- It's good.
- That wasn't a very strong reaction.

150
00:21:36,495 --> 00:21:39,362
Well, it's not a very strong drink.

151
00:21:43,368 --> 00:21:45,393
Just don't tell anyone.

152
00:21:45,470 --> 00:21:48,701
This, of course, breaks some
critical FAA regulations.

153
00:22:19,538 --> 00:22:21,529
Excuse me.

154
00:22:22,174 --> 00:22:25,974
- Sir, excuse me!
- Guess he really had to go.

155
00:22:26,044 --> 00:22:28,274
Sir, excuse me!

156
00:22:40,759 --> 00:22:44,388
<i>The pilot has switched on
the "fasten seatbelts" sign. </i>

157
00:22:44,463 --> 00:22:48,024
<i>Please return to your seats
and fasten your seatbelts. </i>

158
00:22:48,100 --> 00:22:49,901
It's normal.

159
00:22:50,602 --> 00:22:55,164
Oh, I know. I've just
never been a very good flier.

160
00:22:55,240 --> 00:22:59,734
My husband keeps reminding me
that planes want to be in the air.

161
00:22:59,811 --> 00:23:02,143
Well, he sounds like a very smart man.

162
00:23:02,214 --> 00:23:05,877
Be sure and tell him that
when he gets back from the bathroom.

163
00:23:10,989 --> 00:23:13,981
Well, I'll keep you company
until he does.

164
00:23:14,993 --> 00:23:17,587
Don't worry. It's gonna be over...

165
00:23:56,635 --> 00:23:59,365
It didn't sound like an animal,
not exactly.

166
00:23:59,438 --> 00:24:02,771
I keep thinking there
was something familiar about it.

167
00:24:02,841 --> 00:24:05,105
- Where you from?
- Bronx.

168
00:24:05,177 --> 00:24:07,407
- Monkeys.
- Monkey Island.

169
00:24:07,479 --> 00:24:09,606
Don't know
if we're on an island...

170
00:24:09,681 --> 00:24:11,740
You ready?

171
00:24:17,189 --> 00:24:20,181
You showed me where the smoke was.
I can get there myself.

172
00:24:20,258 --> 00:24:21,452
I'm coming.

173
00:24:24,763 --> 00:24:27,664
Well, you're gonna need better shoes.

174
00:25:28,226 --> 00:25:32,390
Whatever it was, it wasn't natural.

175
00:25:32,464 --> 00:25:36,560
- Does anyone have any sunblock?
- Yeah, I do.

176
00:25:37,102 --> 00:25:41,038
So I was just looking
inside the fuselage.

177
00:25:41,106 --> 00:25:43,370
It's pretty grim in there.

178
00:25:43,441 --> 00:25:47,002
You think we should
do something about the...

179
00:25:48,513 --> 00:25:50,538
...B- O-D-Y-S?

180
00:25:52,551 --> 00:25:55,714
- What are you spelling, man, "bodies"?
- B-O-D-l-E-S.

181
00:25:55,787 --> 00:25:57,721
That sounds like a good idea.

182
00:25:57,789 --> 00:26:00,587
No, they'll deal with it
when they get here.

183
00:26:00,659 --> 00:26:02,854
I'm gonna go out
and look for the cockpit.

184
00:26:03,528 --> 00:26:06,932
See if we can find a transceiver to send
a distress signal. Help the rescue team.

185
00:26:06,932 --> 00:26:07,830
See if we can find a transceiver to send
a distress signal. Help the rescue team.

186
00:26:07,899 --> 00:26:09,958
You need to keep an eye
on the wounded.

187
00:26:10,035 --> 00:26:12,629
If the guy in the suit wakes up,
keep him calm,

188
00:26:12,704 --> 00:26:15,400
but don't let him remove
that shrapnel. Understand?

189
00:26:15,473 --> 00:26:18,533
Got it. What about the guy
with the leg? The tourniquet...?

190
00:26:18,610 --> 00:26:21,078
I stopped the bleeding.
I took it off last night.

191
00:26:21,146 --> 00:26:25,549
- He should be all right.
- Yeah, cool. Good job.

192
00:26:25,617 --> 00:26:28,814
- I'll come with. I wanna help.
- I don't need any more help.

193
00:26:28,887 --> 00:26:32,220
No, it's cool. I don't really feel
like standing still, so...

194
00:26:35,327 --> 00:26:36,624
Excellent.

195
00:26:42,934 --> 00:26:44,265
Can I ask you something?

196
00:26:44,336 --> 00:26:49,296
Me? I'd be thrilled. I've been waiting.

197
00:26:49,374 --> 00:26:52,036
Have we ever met anywhere?

198
00:26:52,510 --> 00:26:55,445
No. That would be unlikely.

199
00:26:56,514 --> 00:26:59,176
- I look familiar though, right?
- Yeah.

200
00:27:00,318 --> 00:27:02,878
- You can't quite place it?
- No, I can't.

201
00:27:02,954 --> 00:27:07,186
- Yeah, I think I know.
- You do?

202
00:27:07,258 --> 00:27:12,252
<i>* You all, everybody
You all, everybody</i>

203
00:27:12,697 --> 00:27:14,824
- Never heard that song?
- I've heard it.

204
00:27:14,899 --> 00:27:17,629
- I don't know what that...
- That's us! Drive Shaft!

205
00:27:17,702 --> 00:27:20,933
The ring. Second tour of Finland.
Never heard of Drive Shaft?

206
00:27:21,006 --> 00:27:22,598
- The band?
- Yeah, the band.

207
00:27:22,674 --> 00:27:25,939
- You were in Drive Shaft?
- I am in Drive Shaft. I play bass.

208
00:27:26,011 --> 00:27:27,501
- Serious?
- Yeah. Charlie.

209
00:27:27,579 --> 00:27:29,570
Track three. I do backing vocals.

210
00:27:29,648 --> 00:27:32,913
- My friend Beth would freak.
- Give me Beth's number, I'll call.

211
00:27:32,984 --> 00:27:35,782
- She live nearby?
- You ever heard of Drive Shaft?

212
00:27:35,854 --> 00:27:37,515
<i>* You all, everybody</i>

213
00:27:38,523 --> 00:27:40,491
<i>* You all, every... body</i>

214
00:27:41,359 --> 00:27:43,418
We gotta keep moving.

215
00:27:44,929 --> 00:27:49,389
- They were good.
- They are good. We're still together.

216
00:27:50,435 --> 00:27:53,063
We're in the middle of a comeback.

217
00:28:20,065 --> 00:28:22,727
You guys, is this normal?

218
00:28:23,468 --> 00:28:26,528
This kind of day turning into night.

219
00:28:26,604 --> 00:28:29,402
The-end-of-the-world type weather.
Guys?

220
00:28:42,487 --> 00:28:46,389
I'm telling you, you don't wanna go
in there! There's too many bodies!

221
00:29:05,777 --> 00:29:07,802
There it is again.

222
00:29:08,646 --> 00:29:10,273
Oh, my God.

223
00:29:55,827 --> 00:29:58,955
Well, let's do this.

224
00:30:37,001 --> 00:30:40,027
- Let's get this trans...
- Transceiver.

225
00:30:40,104 --> 00:30:42,732
Transceiver thing and get out of here.

226
00:31:44,802 --> 00:31:46,064
Come on!

227
00:31:52,744 --> 00:31:56,544
- You okay?
- Yeah, you?

228
00:31:56,614 --> 00:31:58,514
Yeah.

229
00:31:59,817 --> 00:32:04,220
I'm fine. Charlie's fine,
by the way. I'm okay.

230
00:32:06,724 --> 00:32:10,592
- Hey, you don't have to come up here.
- No, I'm good.

231
00:32:32,216 --> 00:32:36,550
- So, what does a transceiver look like?
- Like a complicated walkie-talkie.

232
00:33:11,723 --> 00:33:14,453
Hey, can you hear me?

233
00:33:16,928 --> 00:33:18,054
I need that water.

234
00:33:24,569 --> 00:33:26,469
Here. Here you go.

235
00:33:31,809 --> 00:33:35,267
- How many survived?
- At least 48.

236
00:33:36,014 --> 00:33:38,005
- Does anything feel broken?
- No, no.

237
00:33:38,082 --> 00:33:40,846
Just my head's a little dizzy,
that's all.

238
00:33:42,487 --> 00:33:45,047
It's probably a concussion.

239
00:33:45,823 --> 00:33:48,792
- How long has it been?
- Sixteen hours.

240
00:33:48,860 --> 00:33:50,885
Sixteen?

241
00:33:53,431 --> 00:33:56,229
- Has anybody come?
- Not yet.

242
00:34:00,038 --> 00:34:02,563
Six hours in...

243
00:34:04,809 --> 00:34:06,777
...our radio went out.

244
00:34:07,979 --> 00:34:09,606
No one could see us.

245
00:34:10,481 --> 00:34:13,473
We turned back to land in Fiji.

246
00:34:13,551 --> 00:34:16,952
By the time we hit turbulence...

247
00:34:18,289 --> 00:34:20,416
...we were a thousand miles off course.

248
00:34:23,294 --> 00:34:26,786
They're looking for us
in the wrong place.

249
00:34:32,570 --> 00:34:35,164
- We have a transceiver.
- Good, good.

250
00:34:35,239 --> 00:34:37,366
We were hoping.
You shouldn't move.

251
00:34:37,442 --> 00:34:41,401
No, no. I'm okay.
Transceiver's right there.

252
00:34:41,479 --> 00:34:43,071
It's right there.

253
00:34:49,620 --> 00:34:52,054
Where's Charlie?

254
00:35:00,398 --> 00:35:01,831
It's not working.

255
00:35:08,439 --> 00:35:10,407
Charlie?

256
00:35:14,545 --> 00:35:17,912
- What were you doing in the bathroom?
- What?

257
00:35:24,021 --> 00:35:26,046
What the hell was that?

258
00:35:26,624 --> 00:35:28,489
Kate.

259
00:35:34,665 --> 00:35:37,930
- It's right outside.
- What? What's right out...?

260
00:36:37,128 --> 00:36:38,686
What the hell just happened?

261
00:36:58,583 --> 00:37:00,813
Jack, come on!

262
00:37:00,885 --> 00:37:02,352
Just leave it!

263
00:37:46,364 --> 00:37:48,491
- Hey!

264
00:37:59,377 --> 00:38:01,072
Okay, run!

265
00:38:12,490 --> 00:38:15,550
- Jack!

266
00:38:44,121 --> 00:38:46,112
One.

267
00:38:47,792 --> 00:38:50,056
Two.

268
00:38:50,127 --> 00:38:52,595
Three.

269
00:38:52,663 --> 00:38:54,528
Four.

270
00:38:56,600 --> 00:38:59,068
Five.

271
00:39:13,983 --> 00:39:16,042
- Kate!

272
00:39:18,087 --> 00:39:21,215
- Where's Jack? Did you see him?
- I don't know. He pulled me up.

273
00:39:21,291 --> 00:39:22,724
- Where is he?
- I don't know!

274
00:39:22,792 --> 00:39:25,920
- How can you not know?
- I fell down. He came back.

275
00:39:25,995 --> 00:39:28,156
- That thing was...
- Did you see it?

276
00:39:28,231 --> 00:39:29,698
No. No.

277
00:39:29,766 --> 00:39:32,530
But it was right there.
We were dead... I was.

278
00:39:32,602 --> 00:39:36,629
And then Jack came back and he
pulled me up. I don't know where he is.

279
00:39:45,248 --> 00:39:49,150
- We have to go back for him.
- Go back? There?

280
00:39:49,218 --> 00:39:52,381
There's a certain
gargantuan quality about this thing.

281
00:39:52,789 --> 00:39:54,450
Then don't come.

282
00:39:58,628 --> 00:39:59,617
Kate.

283
00:40:27,790 --> 00:40:30,156
I heard you shout.

284
00:40:30,860 --> 00:40:33,488
I heard you shout "Jack."

285
00:40:33,563 --> 00:40:35,463
I'm Charlie, by the way.

286
00:40:39,369 --> 00:40:41,394
What is that?

287
00:41:06,329 --> 00:41:08,354
- What is...?
- It's the pilot.

288
00:41:16,973 --> 00:41:18,998
Did you see it?

289
00:41:19,075 --> 00:41:23,341
No. It was right behind me,
but I dove into the bushes.

290
00:41:24,080 --> 00:41:25,479
Guys...

291
00:41:25,548 --> 00:41:28,676
...how does something
like that happen?
